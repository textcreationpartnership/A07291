            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So is it here.

            <p>The auncient Fathers in the courſe of their writinges, they doe call it the goulden Chaine of our Saluation, becauſe each one of theſe: <hi>Predeſtination, Calling, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> and <hi>glorifyinge,</hi> are ſo coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and knitte together, that if you hould faſt one lincke, you drawe vnto you the whole Chaine: if you let goe one, you loſe all.</p>

            <p>To reſolue then: Sathan at the firſt, was created an Angell of light, and had poſſibilitie to ſtand or fall: but in the <hi>14.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> &amp; the <hi>14.</hi> ver.

               <note place="margin">1. King. 10, 6,</note>The Queene of <hi>Sheba,</hi> when ſhe had ſeene the riches and royaltie of <hi>Solomons</hi> Court, ſhe ſaid vnto the King: It was a true word, which J heard in mine own Land, of thy proſperity and happineſſe, but now I haue ſeene it with mine eyes, lo, the one halfe is not tould me: ſo concerning the glorious fruition of eternitie, in the life to come, whatſoeuer may poſsibly
<pb facs="tcp:2451:23"/>he deliuered by the tongues of men, yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the one halfe cannot bee tould vs.</p>
            <p>By this place of Scripture (thus ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by degrees) the <hi>Kathariſtes,</hi> the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of loue, and the <hi>Puritanes</hi> of our times, would gather this concluſion. For aſ-much, as here are certaine degrees ſet down, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon GODS Church is builded, and whereby, the members of the ſame doe growe vppe in Religion: therefore, now in this life by a godlye reformation, we may attaine vnto perfection.</p>
            <p>This ſelfe conceited and head-ſtrong opinion of theirs, hath beene the firſt cauſe, &amp; ground of all the trouble ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions, which longe ſince haue beene raiſed, &amp; now (at this day) are continued in our Church. For diuers men, while they take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith) <hi>the Onely-wiſe-men,</hi> and pure in their owne eyes, dreaming ſtill of a certaine imagined perfection, they neuer ceaſe to bee clamorous to the Chriſtian <hi>Prince,</hi> troubleſome to the the quiet ſtate, and diuers of them,
<pb facs="tcp:2451:24"/>verie dangerous people, to the whole Church of God. Jn this verſe of our text, there is an ende propounded, there is a marke ſet vp, where-vnto, euery Chriſtian muſt labour to attaine, and ſtriue by all good indeuour to come. But (alas) who can ſay that his heart is cleane; and man that is borne in ſinne, <hi>&amp;</hi> conceiued in iniquitie, while hee is clothed with ſinfull fleſh, how can hee attaine perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
            <p>That the Militant Church of Chriſt, hath had imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in all ages, it is a plaine &amp; an vndoubted truth. For, if euerie member be imperfect, how can there be perfection in the whole? <hi>Perfectio noſtra magis conſtat remiſſione peccatorum, quàm perfectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne virtutum.</hi> Our perfection conſiſeth (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) in the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, then in the perfection of our vertues.</p>
            <p>In truth, thus ſtands the eſtate of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian mans life in this world.</p>
            <p>As a man traueiling a long iournie to a farre cittie, he doth not continually go, but he reſteth here, and ſtayeth there, he baiteth in one place, &amp; loggeth all night in an other,
<pb facs="tcp:2451:24"/>yet ſtill he is going forward, &amp; houldeth on his iournie: ſo in this life we are pilgrims, we are traueilers, and howſoeuer we do ſeeke an other country, and ſtriue to come vnto the cittie of reſt, yet in this iournie wee wander often out of the way, we take many fallés, we haue many impediments; neither is it poſſible, the light of our faith ſhould ſtill hold out, and neuer be darkened in this pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, till in the life to come, wee bee made Citizens of that heauenly <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which is aboue.</p>
            <p>We conclude then with the ſweete and modeſt ſaying of good Saint <hi>Auguſtine. Haec eſt perfectio chriſtianorum, vt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcant ſe nunquám eſſe perfectos.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtands the perfection of a Chriſtian, to acknowledge himſelfe, neuer to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
